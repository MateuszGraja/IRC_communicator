# IRC Communicator - Client & Server

---

## Project Description

This project is a functional, multi-room **IRC-style communicator** implemented in **Python (Client)** and **C (Server)**. It supports basic chat functionalities, nickname changes, room management, and includes a GUI built with `tkinter` for the client.

Designed for local testing or LAN communication, the system features private and public rooms, real-time user list updates, and multi-client support using threads.

Example GUI:
```

|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [12:34:56] Anon1: Hello!                   | Anon1       |
| [12:34:58] Anon2: Hi there!                | Anon2       |
| ...                                        |             |
 -----------------------------------------------------------

```

## Server Highlights
